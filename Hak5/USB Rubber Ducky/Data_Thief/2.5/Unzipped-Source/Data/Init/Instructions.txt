Hi,

So you might be wondering what this directory is for. Well, I got the idea from Linux/Unix (Linux is a modified version of Unix; I believe).
You place a batch file in this directory starting from the numeric value 0. So for example, you could create the batch file "0.bat" and save it
in this directory and it will execute during the execution of DT (Data Thief). DT counts from the number "0" so if a numbered file is missing,
then DT will skip the execution of any other batch files.

Heres an example of a complete init directory layout:

	Contents of "Drive:\Data\Res":
		0.bat - File
		1.bat - File
		2.bat - File
		3.bat - File

Heres an example of a incomplete init directory layout:

	Contents of "Drive:\Data\Res":
		0.bat - File
		2.bat - File
		3.bat - File
		
You may notice that the file "1.bat" is missing. If "1.bat" is missing, then "2.bat" will NOT execute - neither will any of the other scripts
that follow.

When a file is executed from the "Init" directory, it's CD is left as "Drive:\Data" so if required, may need to use the CD command to change the
directory to the required directory. Don't worry about changing the directory back to the original, because Data Thief will restore it back to
the default one.
