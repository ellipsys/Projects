Ok, so I have experience with Linux as well as Windows - so since I like how Linux works, I've decided to get some ideas
from it.

This directory is where you can place *.bat files that can be executed after the SP.bat file has finished executing all 
of its commands.

The batch files must be named as numbers, e.g. 1.bat, 2.bat, 3.bat etc. if you delete one of the batch files, the
ones that follow on will not be executed.
E.g.
1.bat, 2.bat. 3.bat.
If you remove 2.bat, 3.bat will not execute.

Windows won't let me use "init.d\*.bat" to run multiple files, so file names are important.
